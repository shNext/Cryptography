## Overview

Cryptography is interesting field and it is utilized in data transmission/reception over networks and in terminal-devices. <br/>
At first glance, crytography is used to encrypt/decrypt data, but its application scope expands to code tampering and obfuscation. <br/>
I first encountered this field in university and now many times has gone. <br/>
so in this repository I aim to review, and develop related concepts. <br/>
furthermore, with the recent advance of quantum computing I'm also concentrating on quantum cryptography. <br/>

I think this activity has to be consisted of 3 or 4 chapters. <br/>
and I want to write my thought about each chapter after doing the activity for it. <br/>
lastly, maybe others nothing be changed except for details. <br/>

what is the important thing when the reviewers at the company assess me? <br/>
just, it to be appeared on eyes, I think it isnt the answer. the products from the technology also same. <br/>
I need to find the balance for that starting from this. <br/>

Title : cryptographic algorithms development then fundamental thinking about the integration of cryptography with ai and its utilization in embedded systems. <br/>
Purpose : same <br/>
come : sourcecode, if there is time to write a paper then includes it. 

## Development Cycle

#### how long this takes 

just do

## Considerations

#### from cryptography

explain/describe the algorithm from ai is valid in perspective of cryptography. <br/>
explain/prove/describe strength of the algorithm. <br/>
define the conditions of input/output/parameters used in the algorithm comparing with modern cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
how to measure the performance of algorithm. <br/>
how to minimize the algorithm, how to reduce running-time and memory usage for embedded systems. <br/>
how to enhance/transform strength of attack-aware. <br/>
does this algorithm have meaning in perspective of defending from quantum computing, if it is or not, explain about that specifically. <br/>
where should I focus on the parts of the algorithm for security, find the reason and answer.

#### from quantum computing/cryptography

#### from ai

explain the gain in perspective of information security when utilize the ai. <br/>
how to combine the feature/advantage of ai with cryptography. <br/>
how to change the cryptographic algorithms to the ai operations, specify the advantages of this project, even if the quantum computing is coming. <br/>
how to maximize the on-device edge computing with this. <br/>
comparing memory efficiency and usage between ai-combined or not cryptographic algorithms on embedded systems. <br/>
how to encrypt/decrypt the data without the cryptographic key, specify how to do that. <br/>
if it is possible, explain the gain in the enviroments considering private information security. <br/>
how to assess strength/security level of ai-combined algorithm, how to trust it. <br/>
how to enhance strength of algorithm, attack-aware ai cryptographic algorithm, what is this. <br/>
define the meaning of attack about the ai-combined algorithm. <br/>
attack-aware self-logic-transformation cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
how to ensure the consistency of the algorithm. <br/>
design attack-aware self-logic-transformation cryptographic algorithm. <br/>
think about the effect from the quantum computing to this.
