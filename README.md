## Overview

Cryptography is interesting field and it is utilized in data transmission/reception over networks and in terminal-devices. <br/>
At first glance, crytography is used to encrypt/decrypt data, but its application scope expands to code tampering and obfuscation. <br/>
I first encountered this field in university and now many times has gone. <br/>
so in this repository I aim to review, and develop related concepts. <br/>
furthermore, with the recent advance of quantum computing I'm also concentrating on quantum cryptography. <br/>

I think this activity has to be consisted of 3 or 4 chapters. <br/>
and I want to write my thought about each chapter after doing the activity for it. <br/>
lastly, maybe others nothing be changed except for details. <br/>

what is the important thing when the reviewers at the company assess me? <br/>
just, it to be appeared on eyes, I think it isnt the answer. the products from the technology also same. <br/>
I need to find the balance for that starting from this. <br/>

Title : cryptographic algorithms development then fundamental thinking about the integration of cryptography with ai and its utilization in embedded systems. <br/>
Purpose : same <br/>
come : sourcecode, if there is time to write a paper then includes it. 

## Development Cycle

#### how long this takes 

just do

#### Project priority

## Considerations

#### from cryptography

#### from quantum computing/cryptography

#### from ai

## Conclusion on Chapter #. Number
