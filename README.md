## Overview

Cryptography is interesting field and it is utilized in data transmission/reception over networks and in terminal-devices. <br/>
At first glance, crytography is used to encrypt/decrypt data, but its application scope expands to code tampering and obfuscation. <br/>
I first encountered this field in university and now many times has gone. <br/>
so in this repository I aim to review, and develop related concepts. <br/>
furthermore, with the recent advance of quantum computing I'm also concentrating on quantum cryptography. <br/>

## Objective

I can read/understand crytographic algorithm requirements from formal manual </br>
I can develop crytographic algorithm described in the manual </br>
